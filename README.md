FitApp
Description
FitApp is a health and fitness Flutter application designed to help users track their physical and mental well-being through a combination of journaling and health metrics. The app integrates data from wearable devices (steps, heart rate, sleep) and allows users to write journal entries, track their mood, and visualize their progress in an intuitive dashboard.
Key Components
1. Onboarding Flow: A series of visually engaging screens that introduce the app's journaling and visualization features.
2. Interactive Journaling Screen: Users can write journal entries, select their mood using an interactive emoji selector, and save the entry locally.
3. Data Visualization Dashboard: A dashboard displaying health metrics and mood trends over time.
Features
* Onboarding Flow with smooth transitions and motivational content.
* Journaling Screen for writing entries and tracking mood and health data.
* Data Visualization Dashboard with line graphs for mood trends and total step count.
